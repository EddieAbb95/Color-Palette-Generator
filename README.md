Color Palette Generator
======

Simple web page that generates 5 colors following some basic rules to create a nice color set.

How To Use:
------
Simply open the html file in any browser and click the colors. They will automatically regenerate
into new colors with each click. Could (and should) be expanded upon, it was really just a proof
of concept and a chance to practice some Javascript.
